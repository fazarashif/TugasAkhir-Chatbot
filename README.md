# Project Title

This project was carried out to fulfill my graduation requirements in undergraduate education at information systems ITS. In this final project, it is proposed to make a chatbot application using a classification model based on a back propagation neural network (BPNN) which can later be used by parents to carry out the first treatment for their sick child.


## Model's Architecture
obtained the best model architecture with a good level of accuracy and a small loss rate. The best model architecture uses the Adam optimizer, and also to reduce the level of overfitting, the model architecture uses a dropout layer at a rate of 0.5, according to the test results in section 6.2. For the number of neurons from each layer and the best number of epochs used in the training process, the number of neurons in the first hidden layer is 128 and the number of neurons in the second hidden layer is 64 with a total of 800 training epochs.


## Conclusion

1. The Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) Algorithm can be applied as a core model in a chatbot application for the first treatment of sick children.
2. The best JSTPB model for children's disease classification problems in the chatbot application is a model with a number of neurons (128, 64), with 800 training epochs, a dropout rate of 0.5, and using the adam optimizer, getting a training loss value of 0.13, training accuracy of 0.96 (96%), validation loss is 0.68 and has a validation accuracy of 0.81 (81%).
